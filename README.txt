HOW TO USE
1) Upload 'books.html' to the same folder as your homepage (index.html).
2) Upload the entire 'images' folder, keeping the structure:
   images/books/*.jpg
   images/banners/*.jpg
3) All links (cards + top banners) already use your Amazon URLs.
4) Swap banner JPGs later if you want fancier graphics (keep the same filenames).

    <h1>Wondering Why Your Seeds Didn’t Grow: Check This First</h1>
  </header>

      <p>
        Sometimes we plant a whole packet of seeds and nothing comes up. Before you blame your soil or your “green thumb,”
        take a closer look at the seed packet itself. Modern seed packets often include a <strong>“sell by”</strong> or
        <strong>“best by”</strong> date, along with information on days to germination and planting depth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeds don’t last forever. Over time, their germination rate drops. That means fewer seeds will sprout, or none at all.
        Checking the dates and basic instructions on the packet is a simple step that can save you time, money, and frustration.
      </p>
    </section>

    <h2>1. Learn to Read Your Seed Packet</h2>
    <p>
      Most packets will tell you:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Days to germination</strong> – how long before you should see seedlings.</li>
      <li><strong>Planting depth</strong> – how deep to sow the seeds.</li>
      <li><strong>Spacing</strong> – how far apart each plant should be.</li>
      <li><strong>“Sell by” or “Best by” date</strong> – after this date, germination may drop a lot.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Some packets <strong>don’t show any date at all</strong>. When that happens, treat them as if they might be older seed:
      plant a little heavier, and don’t be surprised if the germination rate is low. If you bought them recently, you can also
      ask the shop when that batch came in or if they have fresher stock.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Seeds Have a Life Span</h2>
    <p>
      Recently I learned that many of the seeds we buy today come with a clearly marked life span. This is different from
      the way things were when our parents or grandparents stored seeds for months or years and still got decent results.
      A lot of modern seeds have been bred, treated, or packaged in ways that make the dates on the packet much more
      important.
    </p>
    <p>
      That doesn’t mean every seed “dies” exactly on the printed date, but the older the seed, the lower your chances of
      good germination. If you plant out-of-date seeds and nothing comes up, the problem may not be you – it might be the
      seeds themselves.
    </p>

    <div class="note">
      Tip: If you’re using older seeds or a packet without any printed date, sow a few extra to make up for the lower
      germination rate, and label the tray so you remember which batch might be weaker.
    </div>

    <h2>3. Watch This Short Video on Seed Expiration</h2>
    <section class="video-block">
      <p>
        I did a short video explaining seed expiration and why checking dates matters. You can watch it directly here:
      </p>
      <div class="video-wrapper">

          title="Seed expiration short - Gardening with Kev"
          allowfullscreen
        ></iframe>
      </div>
    </section>

    <h2>4. Before You Buy or Plant</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Check the <strong>“sell by” or “best by”</strong> date on the packet when it’s there.</li>
      <li>If there is <strong>no date</strong>, assume germination might be lower and plant a bit more thickly.</li>
      <li>Read the <strong>germination time</strong> so you know how long to wait before giving up.</li>
      <li>Follow the recommended <strong>depth and spacing</strong> for better success.</li>
      <li>Store unopened packets in a cool, dry place until you’re ready to plant.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Taking a minute to read your seed packet can make a big difference. The goal is to give every seed its best chance
      to grow – and to help you feel more confident every time you plant.

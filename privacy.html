      <h2>1. Who runs this site</h2>
      <p>
        This blog, <strong>Gardening With Kev</strong>, is a personal site where I share my own
        gardening experiences, photos and opinions. It is not owned or managed by Amazon or Google.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Amazon Associate disclosure</h2>
      <p>
        Gardening With Kev participates in the <strong>Amazon Associates Program</strong>.
        This means that when you click on certain links to Amazon and make a purchase, I may
        earn a small commission at no extra cost to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will usually see phrases like <em>&ldquo;As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying
        purchases&rdquo;</em> near these links, or a disclosure in the same section as the products.
      </p>

      <h2>3. What information is collected</h2>
      <p>
        I do not ask you to create an account or log in to use this blog. However, some basic
        information may be collected automatically when you visit the site:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pages visited and time spent on the site</li>
        <li>Approximate location (country/city) based on your IP address</li>
        <li>Device, browser and operating system information</li>
        <li>Referring websites or links</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Google Analytics</h2>
      <p>
        This site uses <strong>Google Analytics</strong> to understand how visitors use the blog,
        such as which pages are most popular and what type of device people are using. Google
        Analytics uses cookies and similar technologies to collect this information.
      </p>
      <p>
        The data collected is used in an aggregated way (for example, total number of visitors,
        most visited pages). I do not use Google Analytics to collect or store any personally
        identifiable information such as your name or address.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can learn more about how Google uses data from sites that use their services by
        visiting Google’s own privacy pages, and you can adjust or block cookies in
        your browser settings if you prefer.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Amazon cookies and tracking</h2>
      <p>
        When you click on an Amazon link on this site, Amazon may place cookies or use other
        tracking technologies to understand that you came from Gardening With Kev. This is
        how they know whether to credit any qualifying purchases to this site.
      </p>
      <p>
        These cookies are controlled by Amazon, not by Gardening With Kev. For more information
        on how Amazon handles data and cookies, please refer to their privacy notices and cookie
        policies on Amazon’s websites.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Third-party links</h2>
      <p>
        This blog sometimes links to other websites (for example, YouTube, Amazon or other
        gardening resources). I am not responsible for the content or privacy practices of
        those external sites. Please review their own privacy policies if you have any questions.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Your choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You can choose not to click on any affiliate links if you prefer not to support the site.</li>
        <li>You can adjust your browser settings to block or delete cookies.</li>
        <li>You can use browser tools that limit analytics tracking.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Contact</h2>
      <p>
        If you have questions about this privacy policy, you can reach me through the contact options on the
